# OCM Bytecode Abstract Type System

Based on the rules and instruction set, OCM has a **stratified type system** with explicit conversion boundaries. Here's the abstract view:

## **1. Core Type Lattice**

```
        Any
       /   \
   Numeric  Binary
   /  |  \     |
byte word bigint blob
```

### **Type Properties:**
- **byte**: `Numeric ∩ Unsigned ∩ Bounded(8)`
- **word**: `Numeric ∩ Signed ∩ Bounded(16)`
- **bigint**: `Numeric ∩ Signed ∩ Unbounded`
- **blob**: `Binary ∩ Sequence(byte)`

## **2. Type System Characteristics**

### **2a. Nominal vs Structural**
```haskell
-- OCM is NOMINAL - types are distinct even with same representation
type Byte = UInt8     -- stored as stack value
type Word = Int16     -- stored as stack value
type BigInt = Ref     -- stored as heap reference
type Blob = Ref       -- stored as heap reference

-- No implicit structural equivalence:
Byte ≠ Word  (even though both fit in 16-bit stack slot)
```

### **2b. Subtyping Relations**
```
byte <: word <: bigint    (widening conversions)
blob >: bigint            (reinterpretation)
```

**Key insight**: OCM has **no implicit subtyping** - all conversions are explicit via instruction calls.

## **3. Abstract Operations**

### **3a. Type Constructors**

```haskell
-- Immediate constructors
Byte(n: 0..255) → byte
Word(n: -32768..32767) → word
BigInt(n: ℤ) → bigint
Blob(bytes: [byte]) → blob

-- Conversion constructors (via instructions)
ToSigned: blob → bigint
ToUnsigned: blob → bigint
ToBinary: numeric → blob
Truncate: bigint → word
Widen: (byte|word) → bigint
```

### **3b. Type Predicates**
```haskell
isFitsInByte: ℤ → Bool
isFitsInWord: ℤ → Bool
isNumeric: Type → Bool
isBinary: Type → Bool
isReference: Type → Bool  -- bigint | blob
isValue: Type → Bool      -- byte | word
```

## **4. Stack Machine Semantics**

### **4a. Stack Value Representation**
```
Stack = [StackValue]
StackValue = SmallInt(Int16) | Reference(Handle)

-- Type erasure at runtime:
byte 42   → SmallInt(42)    -- loses "byte" type info
word 42   → SmallInt(42)    -- loses "word" type info
bigint 42 → Reference(h)    -- heap allocated
blob data → Reference(h)    -- heap allocated
```

### **4b. Type Safety Properties**
```haskell
-- Well-typed operations preserve type invariants
typecheck: Instruction → [Type] → [Type]

-- Examples:
ADD      : [word, word] → [word]
ADD      : [byte, byte] → [word]  -- promotion rule
CVTNUM.S : [blob] → [bigint]
TRUNC16  : [bigint] → [word]
```

## **5. Memory Model Abstractions**

### **5a. Value vs Reference Semantics**
```
Value Types (stack):     byte, word
Reference Types (heap):  bigint, blob

-- Reference counting semantics:
ref_count: Handle → Nat
copy: Reference → Reference  (inc ref_count)
drop: Reference → Unit      (dec ref_count, gc if 0)
```

### **5b. Serialization Types**
```haskell
-- OCM supports both interpretations:
data InterpretAs = Signed | Unsigned

serialize: (bigint, InterpretAs) → blob
deserialize: (blob, InterpretAs) → bigint

-- This enables blob ↔ numeric duality
```

## **6. Type System Design Principles**

### **6a. Explicit Conversion Philosophy**
```
Design Goal: No Hidden Costs
├─ No implicit allocations
├─ No implicit conversions
├─ No implicit precision loss
└─ Programmer controls all type changes
```

### **6b. Performance Stratification**
```
Performance Tiers:
├─ Tier 1: byte/word (stack ops, fast)
├─ Tier 2: DWORD (specialized 32-bit ops)
├─ Tier 3: bigint (heap allocation, arbitrary precision)
└─ Tier 4: blob (binary data, serialization)
```

## **7. Abstract Type Algebra**

### **7a. Type Operations**
```haskell
-- Promotion operations form a lattice
(⊕) : Type → Type → Type  -- join (promote to larger)
byte ⊕ word = word
word ⊕ bigint = bigint
byte ⊕ bigint = bigint

-- Conversion operations (non-lattice)
(→) : Type → Type  -- explicit conversion
blob → bigint  (via CVTNUM.S/U)
bigint → blob  (via CVTBLOB)
bigint → word  (via TRUNC16)
```

### **7b. Type Constraints**
```haskell
-- Instruction families impose type constraints
SmallIntOps: {byte, word} → {word}
BigIntOps: {bigint} → {bigint}
DWordOps: {byte, word, bigint} → {dword_result}
ConversionOps: Type → Type
```

## **8. Comparison with Other Type Systems**

| Feature | OCM | C | Java | Python |
|---------|-----|---|------|--------|
| **Subtyping** | Explicit only | Implicit numeric | Class hierarchy | Duck typing |
| **Precision** | Explicit control | Implementation defined | Fixed sizes | Automatic |
| **Conversions** | All explicit | Implicit + explicit | Some implicit | Automatic |
| **Memory Model** | Value/Ref explicit | Pointer/Value | Reference/Primitive | All references |

## **9. Type System Invariants**

### **9a. Safety Properties**
```haskell
-- Stack safety
wellTyped: Program → Bool
-- No stack underflow/overflow in well-typed programs

-- Memory safety
noLeaks: Program → Bool
-- Reference counting prevents memory leaks

-- Type preservation
preservation: ∀ instruction. typecheck(instruction) preserves types
```

### **9b. Abstraction Properties**
```haskell
-- Representation independence
∀ (n: ℤ). byte(n) ≡ word(n) ≡ bigint(n)  -- same mathematical value
∀ (n: ℤ). blob(serialize(n)) ≡ n          -- serialization isomorphism
```

---

## **Abstract Essence**

OCM's type system is fundamentally about **explicit control over representation and performance**, with a clear separation between:

1. **Computational types** (byte/word/bigint) - optimized for arithmetic
2. **Storage types** (blob) - optimized for serialization/binary data
3. **Explicit bridges** between computational and storage domains

This creates a **type system as performance annotation** - the type tells you exactly what computational and memory costs you're paying.

## Nominal Type System

A nominal type system is a type system where type compatibility and equivalence are determined by explicit declarations and names. Two types are considered the same only if they are declared as such, regardless of their structure.

- Type compatibility:
Whether a value of one type can be used in a context that expects another type.

- Type equivalence:
Type equivalence means two types are considered the same by the type system.

- Explicit declarations and names
Explicit declarations and names mean that types are defined and identified by their given names in the code. A type must be declared with a specific name (e.g., class User {}), and only values of that exact declared type are considered compatible. The system does not infer compatibility based on structure—only on the declared name.

------

Looking at OCM bytecode, the statement about it being a **nominal type system** is true because OCM treats types as fundamentally distinct based on their **declared identity**, not their underlying representation. Here's why:

## **OCM's Nominal Type Behavior**

### **1. Types with Identical Representation Are Still Distinct**

```haskell
-- Both stored as 16-bit values on stack, but treated as different types
type Byte = UInt8     -- stored as SmallInt(value)
type Word = Int16     -- stored as SmallInt(value)

-- Even though both become SmallInt(42) at runtime:
byte 42 ≠ word 42    -- Compiler treats as different types
```

### **2. No Implicit Structural Compatibility**

In a **structural** type system, these would be interchangeable:
```typescript
// Structural typing (TypeScript example)
type UserID = number;
type ProductID = number;
let user: UserID = 123;
let product: ProductID = user;  // ✓ OK - same structure
```

But in OCM's **nominal** system:
```python
# OCM behavior
user_id: byte = 123
product_id: word = user_id  # ✗ ERROR - different nominal types
```

### **3. Explicit Conversion Required**

OCM forces you to explicitly convert between types, even when they're structurally compatible:

```assembly
# Cannot directly use byte where word expected
imm.byte 42        # Push byte
# Need explicit conversion:
CVTNUM.S          # Convert byte→bigint→word (explicit)
# Or use appropriate instruction that accepts byte
```

### **4. Instruction-Level Type Enforcement**

OCM instructions are type-specific, reinforcing nominal distinctions:

```assembly
# Different instruction families for "same" data
ADD      # Works on smallint (byte/word after conversion)
ADD.BIGINT   # Works on bigint only
ADD.DWORD    # Works on 32-bit values only

# Even though 42 could fit in any of these, you must choose
# which instruction family based on nominal type
```

### **5. Reference vs Value Semantics Based on Name**

```haskell
-- Nominal type determines memory model
byte 42    → SmallInt(42)     -- Value semantics (stack)
word 42    → SmallInt(42)     -- Value semantics (stack)
bigint 42  → Reference(h)     -- Reference semantics (heap)
blob data  → Reference(h)     -- Reference semantics (heap)

-- Same value 42, completely different runtime behavior
-- based purely on nominal type declaration
```

## **Contrast with Structural Typing**

If OCM used **structural typing**, it would look like:

```python
# Hypothetical structural OCM
any_8_bit_unsigned = 42   # Could be used as byte
any_16_bit_signed = 42    # Could be used as word
any_integer = 42          # Could be used as bigint

# All interchangeable because structure (integer) is same
```

But actual OCM requires:

```python
# Actual nominal OCM
byte_val: byte = 42       # Specific nominal type
word_val: word = 42       # Different nominal type
bigint_val: bigint = 42   # Yet another nominal type

# Cannot mix without explicit conversion instructions
```

## **Why OCM Chose Nominal Typing**

### **1. Performance Predictability**
```
byte operations   → fast stack arithmetic
bigint operations → slow heap allocation
```
Nominal types make performance costs **explicit and predictable**.

### **2. Cryptographic Safety**
```python
# Prevents accidental mixing of:
key_bytes: blob = [0x12, 0x34]
random_number: bigint = 0x1234

# These represent same bits but completely different meanings
# Nominal typing prevents dangerous confusion
```

### **3. Clear Instruction Mapping**
```assembly
# Each nominal type maps to specific instruction families
byte/word  → SmallInt instructions (0x10-0x1F)
bigint     → BigInt instructions (0x87-0x8F)
blob       → Conversion instructions (0x50-0x54)
```

---

## **Summary**

OCM is nominally typed because **type identity comes from declaration, not structure**. Even when two types have identical bit patterns or value ranges, OCM treats them as completely distinct unless you explicitly convert between them using specific instructions. This gives programmers precise control over performance and prevents accidental type confusion in cryptographic contexts.

The "name/declaration" determines everything: memory layout, instruction family, conversion requirements, and runtime behavior - regardless of structural similarities.
