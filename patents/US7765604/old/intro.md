This invention is about a way to protect digital content—like music, videos, or other media—from being illegally copied or shared without permission from the person or company that owns it.

Why is this needed?
In recent years, people have been using the internet to share music files with each other for free, even if they didn’t buy them or don’t have the right to share them. This means:

One person buys a song.
They share it online.
Many others download it without paying.
As a result, fewer people buy the music, and the creators or copyright owners lose money because they don’t get paid for those extra copies.

What the invention does:
It introduces a system or method—possibly software or hardware—that helps stop this kind of unauthorized sharing. It ensures that only people who have the proper license or permission can use the content.
