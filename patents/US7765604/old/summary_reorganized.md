# Digital Content Protection System (US Patent 7765604)

## üéØ Purpose
This invention is a digital rights management (DRM) system designed to protect digital content (music, videos, software, documents) from unauthorized use. It ensures that only users with valid licenses can access and use protected content.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Client Device Components
The system consists of software/hardware on user devices that:
- **Stores encrypted content** along with metadata identifying required licenses
- **Manages content keys** (encrypted and protected)
- **Handles license validation** and storage
- **Performs content decryption** when authorized

### License Server Components
A centralized server that:
- **Maintains license database** with content permissions and device associations
- **Processes license requests** from client devices
- **Issues signed licenses** bound to specific devices
- **Enforces usage policies** and restrictions

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Content Storage
- Digital content is encrypted and stored with:
  - The encrypted content itself
  - Protected decryption keys
  - License requirement metadata

### 2. License Request Process
When a user attempts to access content:
- System checks for existing valid license
- If no license exists, sends request to license server including:
  - Content identifier
  - Device identifier

### 3. License Issuance
The license server:
- Validates the request
- Retrieves appropriate license from database
- Binds license to requesting device ID
- Signs license with digital signature
- Sends signed license back to device

### 4. Content Decryption
With valid license, the system:
- Uses device-specific key to unlock Enabling Key Block (EKB)
- Extracts root key from EKB
- Uses root key to unlock content key
- Uses content key to decrypt actual content
- Presents decrypted content to user

### 5. Security Enforcement
- **Device binding**: Licenses are tied to specific devices
- **Digital signatures**: Prevent license tampering
- **Usage rules**: Control how content can be used (play count, time limits, etc.)
- **Key hierarchy**: Multiple layers of encryption protection

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features
- Multi-layer encryption with device-specific keys
- Tamper-proof digital signatures on licenses
- Device fingerprinting and binding
- Granular usage policy enforcement
- Secure key distribution through EKB mechanism

## üìã Patent Claims
The patent covers:
- Methods for secure content storage and licensing
- License server architecture and operations
- Client-side license validation and content decryption
- Computer programs implementing the system
- Encrypted program storage for enhanced security

## ‚úÖ Benefits
- **Content creators**: Protection against piracy and unauthorized distribution
- **Users**: Legitimate access to licensed content across authorized devices
- **Distributors**: Controlled content distribution with usage tracking
- **Industry**: Standardized DRM framework for digital content protection
