🧠 What is the invention trying to do?
The goal of this invention is to stop people from using digital content (like music, videos, or software) without permission.

💡 How does it work?
The invention is a system (like a device or software) that only lets you use the content if you have a valid license. Here's how it works, step by step:

Content Storage:
The system stores:

The encrypted content (so it can’t be used directly),
A key to unlock (decrypt) the content,
And information that identifies which license is needed.
License Storage:
It also stores the license itself, which says:

What content it applies to,
And what kind of use is allowed (like playing, copying, etc.).
License Check:
Before you can use the content, the system checks if the correct license is there.

Decryption:
If the license is valid, the system unlocks (decrypts) the content so you can use it.

🛡️ Why is this useful?
It ensures that only people who have permission (a license) can access or use the content. This helps protect the rights of creators and prevents illegal copying or sharing.

🧠 What is this system trying to do?
This system is designed to protect digital content (like music, videos, images, or text) by making sure that only people with permission (a license) can use it.

🔐 How does it work?
Here’s a simplified breakdown of the key parts and how they work together:

Storing the Content Securely
The system stores:

The encrypted content (so it can’t be used without unlocking it),
A key to unlock it (but this key is also protected),
And information about what license is needed.
Checking for a License
Before you can use the content, the system checks if you have the correct license stored.

Getting a License (if needed)
If you don’t have the license yet:

The system sends a request to a license server.
The server sends back the license.
The system stores the license for future use.
Unlocking the Content
If the license is valid:

The system uses a device-specific key to unlock a special file called an EKB (Enabling Key Block).
This gives access to a root key, which is then used to unlock the content key.
Finally, the content key is used to decrypt the actual content.
Playing or Showing the Content
Once decrypted, the content (music, video, image, etc.) can be played or displayed.

Extra Security Checks

The license includes rules about how the content can be used (like how many times or on which device).
It also includes a digital signature to prove it came from a trusted license server.
The system checks that the license matches the specific device it's running on.
🧾 Also included:
A method (step-by-step process) for doing all of this.
A program that can be stored on a computer or device to carry out the process.


🧠 What is this part about?
This section describes how the license server works. The license server is the system that issues licenses to users so they can unlock and use protected digital content (like music, videos, or documents).

🔐 How does the license server work?
Stores Licenses
The server keeps a database of licenses. Each license includes:

What content it applies to (like a specific song or video),
Which device is allowed to use it.
Receives Requests
When a user tries to access protected content, their device sends a license request to the server. This request includes:

The ID of the license it needs,
The ID of the device making the request.
Processes the Request
The server:

Finds the correct license,
Adds the device ID to the license (to lock it to that device),
Signs the license with a digital signature (to prove it’s authentic and hasn’t been tampered with).
Sends the License Back
The signed license is sent back to the user’s device, where it can be stored and used to unlock the content.

💾 Also included:
A method (step-by-step process) for how the license server does all this.
A program that can be stored on a computer to run the license server.
The program or parts of it may be encrypted for security.
✅ Final Summary
This system ensures that:

Only authorized users on approved devices can access protected content.
Licenses are securely issued and verified.
Content can only be used if the correct license is present and valid.
