# US Patent 7765604 - Digital Rights Management System

## Abstract / Summary
> **System Overview**: This patent describes a digital rights management (DRM) system where content distribution and access control are separated.

A client receives encrypted content from content server. The header of the content includes license-identifying information for identifying a license required to utilize the content. The client requests a license server to transmit the license identified by the license-identifying information. When receiving the request for a license, the license server carries out a charging process before transmitting the license to the client. The client stores the license received from the license server. The stored license serves as a condition for encrypting and playing back the content. As a result, content can be distributed with a high degree of freedom and only an authorized user is capable of utilizing the content.

> **Key Innovation**: Separation of content distribution from license validation, enabling flexible content distribution while maintaining strict access control.

## Field of Invention
> **Technical Domain**: Information processing, digital rights management, content protection

In general, the present invention relates to an information processing method, an information processing apparatus, a program storage medium and a program. More particularly, the present invention relates to an information processing method and an information processing apparatus which are used for preventing content from being copied and used illegally without a license from the owner of the copyright in the content, a program for implementing the information processing method and a program storage medium for storing the program.
## Background and Problem Statement
> **Market Problem**: Illegal content sharing through peer-to-peer networks causing revenue loss for content creators

In recent years, users have provided musical data they own to other users and have received musical data they do not own from other users through the Internet in content-exchanging system that allows a plurality of users to exchange musical data free of charge. In Such content-exchanging System, theoretically, music or another content owned by one user can thus be enjoyed by other users. Therefore, many users do not have to purchase Such a piece of music or such content. As a result, since Such a piece of music or Such content does not sell well, the owner of the copyright in the content loses the opportunity to gain a royalty for the use of the piece of music or the content accom panying the sales of the piece of music or the content. In Society, there is thus a demand to prevent content from being copied and used illegally.

> **Objective**: Create a reliable system to prevent unauthorized content usage while maintaining distribution flexibility

## Primary Claims - Information Processing Apparatus
