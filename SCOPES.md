To compile

```c
function outer(x) {
    function inner(y) {
        return x + y;
    }
    return inner(5);
}
```

into an IR (Intermediate Representation) that captures **scopes** and **lexical scoping**, the compiler would need to:

---

## 1. **Represent Scopes and Environments**

- **Scope Tree:**
  Each function introduces a new scope. Scopes are nested (outer → inner).
- **Symbol Table:**
  Each scope has a symbol table mapping variable names to their storage (stack slot, closure index, etc.).
- **Closure Environment:**
  For nested functions, track which variables from outer scopes are referenced (free variables). These must be captured in a closure environment.

---

## 2. **IR Data Structures**

- **Function IR Node:**
  - Name
  - Parameters
  - Body (list of IR statements)
  - Parent scope reference
  - List of free variables (for closure)
- **Scope Object:**
  - Symbol table (variable → location)
  - Parent scope reference
- **Closure/Environment Object:**
  - List of captured variables (with values or references)
- **Call Node:**
  - Function reference (could be a closure)
  - Arguments

---

## 3. **Example IR (Pseudocode)**

```plaintext
FunctionIR: outer
  params: [x]
  scope:
    symbols: { x }
    parent: global
  body:
    FunctionIR: inner
      params: [y]
      scope:
        symbols: { y }
        parent: outer.scope
      free_vars: [x]
      body:
        Return: Add(Var(x), Var(y))
    Assign: inner_closure = Closure(inner, [x])
    Return: Call(inner_closure, [5])
```

---

## 4. **Compiler Steps**

1. **Parse** the source into an AST.
2. **Build scope tree** as you descend into functions.
3. **For each function:**
   - Build its symbol table.
   - Detect free variables (variables used but not defined in the current scope).
   - If free variables exist, generate a closure object that captures them.
4. **When compiling a call to a nested function:**
   - Pass the closure/environment as part of the call.
   - The inner function accesses captured variables via the closure.

---

## 5. **Data Structures Needed**

- **AST nodes** for functions, variables, calls, etc.
- **Scope objects** (with symbol tables and parent pointers)
- **Closure objects** (list of captured variables/values)
- **IR nodes** for statements and expressions, with links to scope/closure info

## 6. **Summary Table**

| Concept         | Data Structure                |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Scope           | Scope object (symbol table)   |
| Lexical scoping | Parent pointers in scopes     |
| Closure         | Closure object (captures)     |
| Function        | Function IR node              |
| Variable access | Symbol lookup, closure lookup |

---

**In short:**
The compiler needs a scope tree, symbol tables, and closure objects to represent nested functions and lexical scoping in the IR. Each function IR node records its free variables and captures them in a closure if needed.

Certainly! Here’s how you can **map the IR representation for scopes and closures to OCM bytecode VM structures**:

---

## 1. **Scopes and Symbol Tables → Stack and Arrays**

- **Local variables** in a scope are mapped to positions on the OCM stack or to indices in a local array.
- The compiler assigns each variable a stack slot or array index.
- When generating bytecode, variable accesses become stack operations (e.g., `DUP`, `ROLLIN`, or array `GET`/`SET`).

---

## 2. **Closures/Environments → Arrays or Blobs**

- **Closure objects** in the IR (which capture free variables) are represented at runtime as OCM arrays or blobs.
- When a function is nested and needs to capture variables, the compiler generates code to:
  - Create an array containing the values of the free variables.
  - Pass this array as an extra argument to the inner function’s blob.

---

## 3. **Function IR Nodes → Blobs (Program Blocks)**

- Each function (including nested ones) is compiled to an OCM blob (a program block).
- If the function is a closure, its blob expects the closure environment array as an argument (usually on the stack).

---

## 4. **Calls and Variable Access**

- **Calling a closure:**
  The closure is represented as a pair: `[function_blob, environment_array]`.
  - To call: Push arguments, push environment array, push function blob, then `EXEC`.
- **Accessing a captured variable:**
  The function blob accesses its environment array using `GET` with the correct index.

---

## 5. **Example Mapping**

### IR:
```plaintext
Assign: inner_closure = Closure(inner, [x])
Return: Call(inner_closure, [5])
```

### OCM Bytecode:
```
PUSH x                ; Capture x
1 ARRAY               ; Create environment array [x]
[inner_blob]          ; Push inner function blob
2 ARRAY               ; Bundle as [inner_blob, env]
STORE inner_closure   ; Store closure

; To call inner_closure(5):
PUSH 5
LOAD inner_closure    ; Load [inner_blob, env]
GET 0                 ; Get inner_blob
GET 1                 ; Get env
EXEC                  ; Call inner_blob with env and 5 on stack
```

### Inside `inner_blob`:
```
; Stack: [env, y]
GET env, 0            ; Get x from env
; Now stack: [x, y]
ADD
RETURN
```

## 6. **Summary Table**

| IR Concept      | OCM VM Structure           | Bytecode Pattern                        |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Scope           | Stack/array               | Stack ops, array ops                    |
| Closure         | Array/blob (environment)  | Create array, pass as argument          |
| Function        | Blob (program block)      | Compile to blob, call with `EXEC`       |
| Variable access | Stack/array lookup        | Stack ops, `GET`/`SET`                  |
| Closure call    | Blob + env array          | Push args, env, blob, then `EXEC`       |

---

**In short:**
- The compiler turns IR scopes into stack/array usage.
- Closures become arrays of captured variables, passed to blobs.
- Functions become blobs, called with `EXEC`.
- All scope and closure management is explicit in the generated bytecode.

This approach allows you to implement full lexical scoping and closures on the OCM VM, even though the VM itself does not natively enforce these rules.
