Yes, you could support **inline C functions** in your high-level language (HLL) module by allowing a special syntax that marks a function as containing C code, which will be compiled to a native module and linked using the OCM module operations.

### Example Syntax

```c
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Inline C function
inline_c function fastmul(a, b) {
    /*
    return a * b;
    */
}
```

Or, using an annotation:

```c
@inline_c
function fastmul(a, b) {
    // C code here
    return a * b;
}
```

### How This Would Work

1. **The compiler detects `inline_c` functions** and extracts their bodies as C code.
2. **The C code is compiled** to a native module blob.
3. **At runtime,** the blob is loaded using `LOADNATMOD` (`0x75`), and a handle is stored.
4. **Calls to the inline C function** are compiled to `CALLNATMOD` (`0x77`), passing arguments via the stack and using the module handle.

### Example Compilation Flow

- HLL code:
    ```c
    inline_c function fastmul(a, b) {
        return a * b;
    }
    ```
- OCM bytecode:
    ```
    [fastmul_module_blob]
    LOADNATMOD
    STORE fastmul_handle

    ; To call fastmul(2, 3):
    PUSH 2
    PUSH 3
    [fastmul_handle]
    CALLNATMOD
    ```

### Summary

- **Yes, you can define inline C functions** in your HLL.
- The compiler extracts, compiles, and loads them as native modules.
- Calls to these functions use the OCM module operations for native interop.

This approach gives you seamless, efficient integration of C code within your high-level language!### Summary
